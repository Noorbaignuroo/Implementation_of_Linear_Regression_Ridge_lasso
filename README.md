Title: Predicting California Housing Prices with Linear Regression, Ridge, and Lasso

Description:
The "fetch_california_housing" dataset is a widely used dataset in the field of machine learning and data science. It is a real-world dataset that contains information about housing prices in various districts across California, making it a valuable resource for exploring and applying regression techniques to predict housing prices. This dataset is commonly employed for educational purposes, research, and practical applications in the realm of predictive modeling.

Dataset Overview:
The "fetch_california_housing" dataset typically includes the following key features:

Median House Value: This is the target variable that we aim to predict using regression techniques. It represents the median value of owner-occupied homes in a specific district, which is a crucial factor in the California real estate market.

Housing Features: The dataset contains several features that provide information about each district, including:

Median Income: The median income of households in the district.
Population: The total population of the district.
Median Age: The median age of residents in the district.
Total Rooms: The total number of rooms in all houses in the district.
Total Bedrooms: The total number of bedrooms in all houses in the district.
Latitude: The latitude coordinate of the district's centroid.
Longitude: The longitude coordinate of the district's centroid.
Using Linear Regression, Ridge, and Lasso:
In the context of predicting California housing prices, Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression are commonly applied regression techniques:

Linear Regression: Linear regression models aim to establish a linear relationship between the predictor variables (features) and the target variable (median house value). This straightforward technique assumes that the relationship is linear and attempts to find the best-fit line that minimizes the prediction error.

Ridge Regression: Ridge regression is an extension of linear regression that introduces regularization. It helps mitigate the problem of multicollinearity and overfitting by adding a penalty term to the linear regression equation. This regularization term encourages smaller coefficients, which can lead to more stable and accurate predictions.

Lasso Regression: Lasso regression is another regularization technique that is similar to Ridge but with a different penalty term. Lasso not only helps prevent overfitting but also performs feature selection by driving some feature coefficients to exactly zero. This makes it particularly useful when dealing with datasets containing many features, some of which may be less relevant.

By applying these regression techniques to the "fetch_california_housing" dataset, you can build predictive models that estimate housing prices based on various district characteristics. These models are essential tools for real estate professionals, policymakers, and anyone interested in understanding and forecasting California housing market trends.
