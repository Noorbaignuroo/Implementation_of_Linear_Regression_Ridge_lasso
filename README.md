# Computer Vision Facial Emotion Detection Project (Fer2013 Dataset)

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for a Computer Vision project focused on Facial Emotion Detection using the Fer2013 dataset. Emotion detection from facial expressions is a crucial task in computer vision with a wide range of applications, including human-computer interaction, sentiment analysis, and facial recognition systems.

In this project, we leverage the Fer2013 dataset, a well-known dataset containing grayscale images of faces categorized into seven different emotions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral. We aim to build a robust emotion detection model using deep learning techniques.

## Dataset

The Fer2013 dataset is an essential component of this project. It comprises the following key features:

- **Emotion Labels**: Each image in the dataset is labeled with one of the seven emotion categories, allowing us to train and test our model for emotion classification.

- **Facial Images**: The dataset consists of grayscale facial images with pixel values representing the intensity of each pixel. These images serve as the input to our emotion detection model.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started with this project, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- **Python**: You should have Python installed on your system.

- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: Install deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras to build and train your model.

- **Jupyter Notebook**: For running and experimenting with code, Jupyter Notebook is recommended.

- **Fer2013 Dataset**: Download the Fer2013 dataset and ensure it's properly organized in a directory for training and testing.

## Getting Started

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare the dataset for training. This includes resizing images, data augmentation, and splitting it into training and testing sets.

2. **Model Building**: Create and train a deep learning model for emotion detection. You can use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or other architectures suitable for image classification.

3. **Training**: Train your model using the training dataset. Experiment with different hyperparameters and architectures to optimize model performance.

4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using the testing dataset. Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its effectiveness in emotion detection.

5. **Visualization**: Visualize the model's predictions and explore misclassified samples to gain insights into its performance.

6. **Fine-Tuning**: If necessary, fine-tune your model to improve its accuracy and robustness.

7. **Deployment (Optional)**: If applicable, deploy the model in a real-time or batch processing environment for emotion detection in real-world scenarios.

Using Linear Regression, Ridge, and Lasso:
In the context of predicting California housing prices, Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression are commonly applied regression techniques:

Linear Regression: Linear regression models aim to establish a linear relationship between the predictor variables (features) and the target variable (median house value). This straightforward technique assumes that the relationship is linear and attempts to find the best-fit line that minimizes the prediction error.

Ridge Regression: Ridge regression is an extension of linear regression that introduces regularization. It helps mitigate the problem of multicollinearity and overfitting by adding a penalty term to the linear regression equation. This regularization term encourages smaller coefficients, which can lead to more stable and accurate predictions.

Lasso Regression: Lasso regression is another regularization technique that is similar to Ridge but with a different penalty term. Lasso not only helps prevent overfitting but also performs feature selection by driving some feature coefficients to exactly zero. This makes it particularly useful when dealing with datasets containing many features, some of which may be less relevant.

By applying these regression techniques to the "fetch_california_housing" dataset, you can build predictive models that estimate housing prices based on various district characteristics. These models are essential tools for real estate professionals, policymakers, and anyone interested in understanding and forecasting California housing market trends.
